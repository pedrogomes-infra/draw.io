# Test draw.io

This repo was created just to test draw.io integration with Github.

## Scenario 1: Without external apps

We can import a .png file directly to draw.io (no need for .xml) so i'm rendering a .png file and providing a link to draw.io to edit this file and create a new one from this.

## Scenario 2: With external draw.io app

We also have the possibility to use a <a href="https://github.com/apps/draw-io-app">draw.ip App<a> to edit the diagrams inside Github as an iframe but for that we need to add an external application to the organization. An example can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-github">here</a> (and a good explanation <a href="https://drawio.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/16000042371-embed-a-diagram-in-github-markdown">here</a>).
